# AlgoTecture

## Executive Summary

AlgoTecture is an algorithmic technology whose name comes from the abbreviation of Algorithmic Architecture with the core mission of leveraging the accessibility of architecture using algorithms to make people's expectations affordable by following the vision of driving any built space on the earth autonomously accessible. 

AlgoTecture’s product is a decentralised data management framework that enables stakeholders involved in building design, construction, operation and financing for data delivery in an ultimate peer-to-peer manner. At AlgoTecture, the aim has always been to establish collaborative coherence among peers working on the design, construction, and operation of buildings and spaces.

## [Owner Declaration Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWlzitjaanswORgW8kdxa-Y74ESpP7UStYQfxFpjL0cBx2Ow/viewform) 

The [Owner Declaration Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWlzitjaanswORgW8kdxa-Y74ESpP7UStYQfxFpjL0cBx2Ow/viewform) is an online form designed to help owners save data and information related to their property. It allows owners to quickly and easily enter information such as the address, property type, ownership type, and any improvements made to the property. The form also allows owners to provide details about the relevant information. Once the form is completed and submitted, the owner can save it and use it as a reference point in the future through the Algotecture Interfaces. 

The form is a great way for owners to keep their information organized and easily accessible.


## Data Model

A [Data Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model) is an abstract representation or conceptual model that defines a specific domain's structure, relationships, constraints, and semantics. It provides a high-level view of how a system organises and accesses data. Data models can be used to describe the logical structure of a database or the flow of data in an application. They serve as a blueprint for designing and implementing databases or information systems.

##  Data Structure

A data structure refers to the specific way data is organized, stored, and manipulated within a computer program or memory. It focuses on the implementation details and efficiency of accessing and manipulating data elements. Data structures determine how data is stored in memory and provide operations or algorithms for performing operations on the stored data.
